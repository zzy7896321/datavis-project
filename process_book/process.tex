\section{Data Collection}

We have collected data from FDIC website with a list of failed banks since Oct
2000, which contains acquiring institutions, and another list of failed banks
since the establishment of FDIC.

We joined the two tables based on their CERT number, which is a primary key of
the tables. We filtered out any items that has N/A in the estimated loss
column, which are all in 2017. Now we have data from Oct 2000 to Dec 2016.

We also want to get the geographic coordinates (longitutde and latitude) of
the headquarters of the failed banks. We used a site called www.latlong.net.
The site has a input box where one can enter the name of a location and a
button ``find'', which loads the latitude and longitude into the other two
input boxes when clicked. This website is awesome except that the api are
hidden in a complex and lengthy JavaScript. Instead of trying to decipher the
JavaScript code, we wrote a script to emulate input and click to fetch the
coordinates for a list of locations. The script is in data/latlong.net.js,
where the first part is used to load jQuery and has to be run first
separately. After a few seconds, we can paste the remaining part of the script
into the console in Chrome. Then we set the city\_names global variable to a
list of locations we want to get coordinates for and invoke start\_first().
After a while, the results global variable is populated with a list of triple
of location name, latitude and longitude.

A note to the script: there has to be a wait after both input to the location
name box and clicking the find button. I don't know if this is due to the lag
of my system or network issue or google map needs more time to load or their
bugs. Now I set both waits at 5 seconds. On my own laptop, this allows me to
fetch more than 300 locations in a row without any error. In case an error
occurs, an alert dialog (which is part of the website's design, not mine),
will pop up saying invalid location. When this happens, the current location
in the input box has better to be recorded so that we can come back to do it
again (manually of course). The remainder of the script will typically run as
usual. From my personal experience, when the number of location gets near 400,
the error starts to pop up every 1 or 2 locations. I had to manually correct
about 40 locations.

We then joined the coordinates with the data. Some of the data are in Puerto
Rico, which cannot be correctly displayed by d3.geoAlbersUsa(). We simply
filtered out those records.
